        The “Where's My Ball Tournament” started in the summer of 2013 after our
        freshmen year of college. We were at Maddie Clough's house (Derrick's
        old slam piece) and brilliantly came up with the idea of having a
        traveling trophy go to the loser of an annual golf tournament. Thus the
        pink, I SUCK AT GOLF, flag was born. The flag is presented each year to
        the person with the worst score after 18 holes of golf. The flag is then
        flown with pride for one year for all the world to see.

        It's not about winning the tournament, it's about making sure you don't
        lose

# The Flag Tourney Website

## Description
The Annual "Where's My Ball" Tournament was created by my friends and I back in the summer of 2013. We came up with the idea of having a traveling trophy go to the loser of an annual golf tournament. Thus the pink, I SUCK AT GOLF, flag was born. The flag is presented each year to the person with the worst score after 18 holes of golf. The flag is then flown with pride for one year for all the world to see. This website was created as a way for us to keep track of past winners and losers as well as other flag tourney memories throughout the years.  

 
It’s not about winning the tournament, it’s about making sure you don’t lose.

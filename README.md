# The Flag Tourney Website

## Description
The “Where’s My Ball Tournament” started in the summer of 2013 after our freshmen year of college. We came up with the idea of having a traveling trophy go to the loser of an annual golf tournament. Thus the pink, I SUCK AT GOLF, flag was born. The flag is presented each year to the person with the worst score after 18 holes of golf. The flag is then flown with pride for one year for all the world to see.

 
It’s not about winning the tournament, it’s about making sure you don’t lose.
